# Project Short discription

We are building a modern AI smart messager client for several messangers, currently for telegram.

# Design

We are using ShadCN UI for modern, beautiful, simple and user-friendly deisgn.
Do not hesitate to import any components from the external library ShadCN,
if you need so, you can write CSS code as well, but mainly keep project beautiful
and organized

## Cyberpunk Theme Standards

Our project follows a **CYBERPUNK/SCI-FI aesthetic** with the following design principles:

### 🎨 **Visual Design Requirements:**

- **Color Palette**: Neon cyan (#00ffff), magenta (#ff00ff), yellow (#ffff00), green (#00ff00), purple gradients
- **Typography**: Use `Orbitron` for headings/logos, `Rajdhani` for body text, both from Google Fonts
- **Background**: Black base with particle systems, cyberpunk grid overlays, and neon gradients
- **Brand Name**: Always use "chathut" in lowercase with cyberpunk styling

### 🔧 **Required Libraries & Effects:**

- **GSAP**: For 3D transforms, holographic card effects, and smooth animations
- **Framer Motion**: For page transitions, staggered animations, and interactive elements
- **TypeAnimation (react-type-animation)**: For typewriter effects in hero sections
- **Custom Canvas**: Particle systems with interconnected neon nodes
- **CSS Animations**: Glitch effects, neon pulse, holographic scanning, matrix rain

### 🎯 **UI Component Standards:**

- **Buttons**: Cyberpunk-btn class with sliding neon effects and gradient backgrounds
- **Cards**: HolographicCard components with 3D transforms and neon borders
- **Text**: GlitchText components with periodic glitch animations
- **Icons**: Hexagonal containers for logos, Terminal icons for branding
- **Borders**: Animated neon borders with color-cycling effects

### 💫 **Animation Guidelines:**

- **Performance**: Always use transform-gpu class for hardware acceleration
- **Interactions**: Hover effects with scale transforms and neon glow increases
- **Loading**: Cyber-themed loading animations with rotating elements
- **Transitions**: Smooth 60fps animations using GSAP and Framer Motion

### 🛡️ **Code Standards for Cyberpunk UI:**

- Import custom CSS with cyberpunk animations: `import "./ComponentName.css"`
- Use `font-orbitron` and `font-rajdhani` classes for typography
- Apply `cyberpunk-btn`, `neon-border`, `glitch-text` classes when appropriate
- Always include particle backgrounds and grid overlays for immersive experience
- Maintain dark theme with neon accents throughout the entire application

# Project Rules

Yo, listen up. Here are the rules for this project. Stick to 'em and we'll be golden.

## General Principles

- We are building in the local developmet phase, but do not forget that we also have a production site and DO NOT HARDCODE, remember that the project's updates should always be ready for production deploy
- **Keep Shit Organized:** A clean project is a happy project. We're talking clear structure for files and folders. Don't just dump files anywhere.
- **Freedom to Create:** If you need a new file or folder to keep things tidy, just fucking do it. Don't hesitate. More files are better than one giant messy one.
- **Modern Tech Only:** We're using the latest and greatest. Use modern features from Python, TypeScript, React, and whatever else we're using. No old-school bullshit.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** This is a big one.
  - **Backend Code:** All Python and backend-related logic lives in the `back/` directory.
  - **Frontend Code:** All TypeScript, React, and UI stuff goes in the `front/` directory.

## Backend (`back/`)

- **API Endpoints:** New API routes go in the `back/api/` folder. Create new files for different resources (e.g., `users.py`, `products.py`).
- **Main Entrypoint (`main.py`):** Keep `main.py` clean as a whistle. It's just for starting the FastAPI app and hooking up the API routers from `back/api/`. No business logic here.
- **Database Models:** Define all Pydantic or ORM models in the `back/models/` directory.
- **Authentication:** All things related to logging in, signing up, and tokens go in `back/auth/`.
- **Telegram Integration:** Anything related to the Telegram API lives in `back/telegram/`.
- **Utilities:** Reusable helper functions and utilities for the backend go into `back/utils/`.

## Frontend (`front/`)

- **Components:** All React components are in `front/components/`.
- **Component Structure:** Organize components by feature. For example, if you're working on a chat feature, create a `front/components/chat/` directory.
  - Each component should have its own folder containing the `.tsx` file and its corresponding `.css` file (e.g., `front/components/chat/Chat.tsx`, `front/components/chat/Chat.css`).
- **State Management:** For global state, use the `front/components/store/` directory. Looks like we might use something like Zustand or Redux here.
- **UI Helpers:** Small, reusable UI components can go into `front/components/ui/`.
- **Frontend Utilities:** Reusable helper functions for the frontend go into `front/components/utils/`.
- **API Client:** Logic for talking to our backend API should be centralized, maybe in something like `front/components/TelegramClient.tsx` or a dedicated API client file.

## Code Style

- **Readability is King:** Write code that's easy to read. Another developer (or your future self) should be able to understand it without wanting to gouge their eyes out.
- **Don't Over-comment:** Comment complex parts, but don't state the obvious. Good code should be self-documenting for the most part.
- **Keep it DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself. If you're copying and pasting code, you're probably doing it wrong. Turn it into a reusable function or component.
- **Linter is Law:** Pay attention to the linter. It's there to help us not write shitty code.

Stick to these, and we'll build something awesome without creating a fucking mess. I'll make sure to follow these rules to save your ass from a world of pain.

## Updating README.md in the root directory

- Keep writing the changes we have done very shortly under the version number, just to keep the update and version list актуальным. Do not write every single small code change, just write what is the new, like for the users, not for the programmers.Do not commit to github anything, user will do that himself. Do no delete the data in this file about the old versions

## About .env

- There is a envcopty.txt, you can freely check it, I trust you. It is the exact copy of .env with all real keys, you can modify it if needed, I will then manually update the actual .env file

## Other sources

- If you need user to interact with docker application or any other application that you do not have straight accsess to, then ask user to do so.
