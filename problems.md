#Problems to be solved:

##

-when the suggested message by AI was sent, it does not dissapear from the AI suggests blue hint

##

- it seems to me that AI does not clearly distingieshes the messages that were sent by the user and the other person, it needs clearly understand which ones are whose. Just need to check, I am not sure. AI must think that it is the user. It must think that it is a human. It must think that old messages that were sent by user are its, even if were not generated by AI directly. It must feel the user

##

- Filter of chats is not working properly, currently all the chats are constantly displaying

#Resolved:

##

- sometimes it answers to the old messages that are pretty recent but are not actual. We need to make it prioritize new incoming messages over older ones, but still remember what was written before to not repeat itself again

##

- it is also worth-mentioning to match the users style of communication, like when user usually types starting with the lowercase letter, AI must also type with the lowercase letter to match the user style even better
