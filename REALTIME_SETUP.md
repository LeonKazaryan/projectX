# Real-time Telegram Messaging Setup

Yo bro! Here's how to test the real-time messaging feature that I just implemented for you.

## What I Fixed

Your Telegram client wasn't updating in real-time because:

1. **Frontend wasn't using WebSocket** - It was only doing HTTP requests
2. **Backend had separate manager instances** - API calls and WebSocket used different telegram managers
3. **No connection monitoring** - Hard to debug when shit went wrong

## What's New

### Backend Changes

- **Global Telegram Manager**: All API routes now use the same manager instance as WebSocket
- **Better WebSocket Handling**: Proper heartbeat/ping-pong system
- **Connection Monitoring**: Added WebSocket monitor for debugging
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better logging and cleanup

### Frontend Changes

- **Real-time WebSocket Connection**: Messages appear instantly without refresh
- **Chat List Real-time Updates**: Last messages and unread counts update automatically
- **Connection Status Indicators**: Green/Yellow/Red dots show connection status in both message area and chat list
- **Auto-reconnection**: Automatically tries to reconnect if connection drops
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't show the same message twice
- **Smart Unread Counting**: Unread counts increment for inactive chats, reset when chat is selected

## How to Test

1. **Start the Backend**:

   ```bash
   cd back/
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd front/
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Login to Telegram**:

   - Go to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Use MTProto login with your phone number
   - Select a chat

4. **Test Real-time Updates**:

   - Open the same chat in your real Telegram app (mobile/desktop)
   - Send a message from your phone/desktop
   - **BAM!** It should appear instantly in the web client without refresh
   - **BONUS**: The chat list on the left will also update with the new message and unread count!

5. **Check Connection Status**:

   - Look for the colored dots in both the message header AND chat list header
   - ðŸŸ¢ = Connected and working
   - ðŸŸ¡ = Connecting
   - ðŸ”´ = Disconnected (will try to reconnect)

6. **Test Chat List Updates**:
   - Select a different chat while someone sends messages to the first chat
   - Watch the unread count increase in the chat list
   - Switch back to see the count reset to 0

## Debugging

- **Check Backend Logs**: Look for `[WS-MONITOR]` messages
- **Check Health Endpoint**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/api/health` for stats
- **Browser Console**: Check for WebSocket connection logs
- **Network Tab**: Make sure WebSocket connection is established

## Common Issues

1. **Connection Red**: Check if backend is running on port 8000
2. **Messages Not Appearing**: Make sure you're in the right chat
3. **Duplicate Messages**: This shouldn't happen anymore, but refresh if it does

Now you can chat in real-time like a boss! No more manual refreshing bullshit.

## Technical Details

- **WebSocket URL**: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/{session_id}`
- **Message Format**: JSON with `type` and `data` fields
- **Heartbeat**: 30-second ping/pong to keep connection alive
- **Auto-reconnect**: 3-second delay after disconnection
